# Project 6: Improving BioHackrXiv.org

## Abstract

BioHackrXiv is the publishing platform for Biohackathons. For this hackathon we aim to improve the editorial/submission process by automating generation of publications and creating useful metadata in the form of RDF which gets exposed through a SPARQL end point. In addition we would like to link up Jupyter and R markdown notebooks so authors can publish live code with their static papers.

## Progress reporting

We are hosting a Google Doc to keep track of [our work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O8n7OMuB3e-S8gHbhcn6XHpza1qOi_DHNNsAE_eUsGA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Expected outcomes

* Forms for entering metadata as part of submission
 * Extract metadata from paper
 * RDF store with metadata and SPARQL end point

Code is hosted on https://github.com/biohackrxiv/. Publication
is written in [paper.md](https://github.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/blob/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2020/paper.md).

## Expected audience

There will be people working locally and remotely on this. Participants may be interested in ontologies, text mining, and some web programming.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
