# Project 6: Improving BioHackrXiv.org

## Abstract

BioHackrXiv is the publishing platform for Biohackathons. For this hackathon we aim to improve the editorial/submission process by automating generation of publications and creating useful metadata in the form of RDF which gets exposed through a SPARQL end point. In addition we would like to link up Jupyter and R markdown notebooks so authors can publish live code with their static papers.
