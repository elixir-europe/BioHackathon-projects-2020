# Project 32: User interface for plant experimental metadata management: EBI(DSP)-ISA-FAIRDOMHub/SEEK harmonization

## Abstract

Despite the general demand for research data that meet FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability), there are very few tools available that try to help researchers generate FAIR data by design. FAIRDOMHub/SEEK is a very flexible platform for sharing research projects; ISA tools and formats are a general purpose framework to collect and communicate complex metadata from experiments employing a combination of technologies. Both systems are used by several scientific communities, within ELIXIR and beyond, as suitable systems for research data management. ...

### Nominated participant(s)

- Stuart Owen, UMAN for FAIRDOMHub/SEEK, stuart.owen@manchester.ac.uk
- Cyril Pommier, INRA Centre de Versailles-Grignon for MIAPPE, cyril.pommier@inrae.fr
- Philippe Rocca-Serra, University of Oxford e-Research Centre, philippe.rocca-serra@oerc.ox.ac.uk
- Dominique Batista, University of Oxford e-Research Centre

## Expected outcomes

1) FAIRDOMHub/SEEK compliance to ISA formats
 2) Possibility to incorporate standard metadata schema in FAIRDOMHub/SEEK, such as MIAPPE, to describe experimental data
 3) Proof of concept for exporting data from FAIRDOMHub/SEEK to EBI repositories

## Expected audience

Ideally, the project requires experts in ISA format, EBI repositories, DSP and Plant data standards specifications, but would benefit from the contribution of any life science researcher interested in data management platform for FAIR data.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4 days
