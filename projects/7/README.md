# *Project* 7 CNV detection software containerisation and benchmark (14)

## Abstract

The main objective of this project is to allow an efficient, unbiased and reproducible way to benchmark a set of tools through software containerization. Here we will use Copy Number Variation detection tools as a use-case. Copy Number Variations are mutational events vital for evolution and they play an important role in diseases. Even if CNVs are the most prevalent genetic mutation type, identifying and interpreting them is still a major challenge. The ELIXIR human Copy Number Variation (hCNV) Community aims to implement processes to make the detection, annotation, and interpretation of ...

### Nominated participant(s)

To be defined once the project accepted. Will be one of the project leaders or additional contributors such as Steve Laurie CNAG-CRG or Lennart Johansson UMCG

## Expected outcomes

All these steps will allow the group to generate a step-by-step for users to do the same process for any set of tools and therefore will be useful to any community of users within ELIXIR and beyond.
 This project will provide incredible outcomes for the ELIXIR hCNV community, the Tools platform (bio.tools, OpenEbench, Galaxy …), will serve as a use-case for the Strategic Implementation Study BioContainers, and any other user community that would like to test a large batch of software in a reproducible and easy to deploy environment within available computational infrastructures.

## Expected audience

Any contributor is welcome but participants with skills in container creation, benchmarking and any other Elixir Services (data, tools, compute and training) are expected.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
