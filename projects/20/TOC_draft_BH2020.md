## Title: CAB Computer aiden biodiversity

### Introduction

*  Biodiversity overview

*  Link between traditional and molecular biodiversity

  * Importance of molecular sequences and their associated metadata
  
  * Importance of a consensus taxonomy

* Taxonomy backbones and their characteristics: CoL, GBIF

  * Unlinked to molecular sequences

* Introduction to taxonomy treatments

  * SynoSpecies

  *  Treatment Bank

*  Aim of the present study

### Materials and Methods

* ENA as primary DB for molecular sequences 

* NCBI Taxonomy as structured TaxonomyDB linked to ENA

* Observation data

  * User-defined 

  * GBIF

* Linking Observation data with ENA and NCBI taxonomy

  * Taxids

  * Ad-hoc retrieval scripts/parsers

* Enhancing observation data

  * Querying SynoSpecies and TreatmentBank

* Data representation: interactive dashboard

### Results

* Use-case 1: Rhinolophus genus

* Use-case 2: 

* Use-case 3: 

### Discussion

* How we enhanced the information

* Updated taxa names (still old in the accession flat file)

* Needed cleaning of Taxa names present in NCBI

* Updated  molecular data?

### Recommendations and perspectives
