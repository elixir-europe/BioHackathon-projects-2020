# Project 20: CAB: Computer Aided Biodiversity

## Abstract

Currently, the management and visualization of molecular data have become a key point due to the strong increase in the availability of information and the consequent possibility to improve our abilities to inference new rules. Studies investigating biodiversity are a clear example of how, collecting more information such as species distribution, community composition, and the presence of invasive or endangered species, we can improve our knowledge of ecosystems and our ability to understand the interactions among organisms. In recent years, metagenomic approaches (e.g. metabarcoding) based ...

## Expected outcomes

- A tool to query the database (i.e. ENA) using a list of unique taxonomic code (TAXID)
 
 - Retrieve geographical and molecular information (gene tag) and at the same time to correct the possible incongruences (ex. two different gene names for the same accession) using text-mining strategies
 
 - The creation of an efficient visualization of queries output (interactive dashboard)

## Expected audience

- basic programming in python or R
 - text-mining
 - taxonomy data management
 - data visualization

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
