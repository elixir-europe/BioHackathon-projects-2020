  abstract     = {Web services have become a key technology for bioinformatics, since life science databases are globally decentralized and the exponential increase in the amount
 of available data demands for efficient systems without the need to transfer entire databases for every step of an analysis. However, various incompatibilities among database re
sources and analysis services make it difficult to connect and integrate these into interoperable workflows. To resolve this situation, we invited domain specialists from web ser
vice providers, client software developers, Open Bio* projects, the BioMoby project and researchers of emerging areas where a standard exchange data format is not well establishe
d, for an intensive collaboration entitled the BioHackathon 2008. The meeting was hosted by the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS) and Computational Biology Research Center
 (CBRC) and was held in Tokyo from February 11th to 15th, 2008. In this report we highlight the work accomplished and the common issues arisen from this event, including the stan
dardization of data exchange formats and services in the emerging fields of glycoinformatics, biological interaction networks, text mining, and phyloinformatics. In addition, com
mon shared object development based on BioSQL, as well as technical challenges in large data management, asynchronous services, and security are discussed. Consequently, we impro
ved interoperability of web services in several fields, however, further cooperation among major database centers and continued collaborative efforts between service providers an
d software developers are still necessary for an effective advance in bioinformatics web service technologies.},

    abstract = {Accuracy of taxonomic identifications is crucial to data quality in online repositories of species occurrence data, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which have accumulated several hundred million records over the past 15 years. These data serve as basis for large scale analyses of macroecological and biogeographic patterns and to document environmental changes over time. However, taxonomic identifications are often unreliable, especially for non-vascular plants and fungi including lichens, which may lack critical revisions of voucher specimens. Due to the scale of the problem, restudy of millions of collections is unrealistic and other strategies are needed. Here we propose to use verified, georeferenced occurrence data of a given species to apply predictive niche modeling that can then be used to evaluate unverified occurrences of that species. Selecting the charismatic lichen fungus, Usnea longissima, as a case study, we used georeferenced occurrence records based on sequenced specimens to model its predicted niche. Our results suggest that the target species is largely restricted to a narrow range of boreal and temperate forest in the Northern Hemisphere and that occurrence records in GBIF from tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere do not represent this taxon, a prediction tested by comparison with taxonomic revisions of Usnea for these regions. As a novel approach, we employed Principal Component Analysis on the environmental grid data used for predictive modeling to visualize potential ecogeographical barriers for the target species; we found that tropical regions conform a strong barrier, explaining why potential niches in the Southern Hemisphere were not colonized by Usnea longissima and instead by morphologically similar species. This approach is an example of how data from two of the most important biodiversity repositories, GenBank and GBIF, can be effectively combined to remotely address the problem of inaccuracy of taxonomic identifications in occurrence data repositories and to provide a filtering mechanism which can considerably reduce the number of voucher specimens that need critical revision, in this case from 4,672 to about 100.},

The identification of these flies is decisive in forensic casework and can be facilitated by using DNA barcodes provided that a representative and comprehensive reference library of DNA barcodes is available.We constructed a local (Belgium and France) reference library of 85 sequences of the COI DNA barcode fragment (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene), from 16 fly species of forensic interest (Calliphoridae, Muscidae, Fanniidae). This library was then used to evaluate the ability of two public libraries (GenBank and the Barcode of Life Data Systems &ndash; BOLD) to identify specimens from Belgian and French forensic cases. The public libraries indeed allow a correct identification of most specimens. Yet, some of the identifications remain ambiguous and some forensically important fly species are not, or insufficiently, represented in the reference libraries. Several search options offered by GenBank and BOLD can be used to further improve the identifications obtained from both libraries using DNA barcodes.},

abstract = {Summary Whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences provide a powerful approach for investigating and hypothesizing relationships at a broad range of phylogenetic levels, and these data have been used extensively across the diversity of fishes. Mitogenome sequence studies have typically used an exemplar approach wherein one individual is sampled and sequenced. However, as more laboratories are producing these data, taxon sampling within clades, including within-species sampling, is naturally increasing. There are currently eleven acipenserids with complete mitogenome sequences available for download and use from GenBank. Exploration of these sequences indicates that the mitogenome for Acipenser sinensis, the Chinese sturgeon, may either be incorrectly identified or the result of undocumented hybridization with A. gueldenstaedtii. Recently, new material with vouchered specimens has been collected and investigated with DNA sequence data from four mtDNA loci to test whether the published mitogenome of A. sinensis was recovered in the same clade with the new vouchered material. This example reinforces the need for voucher specimens and materials for genetic sequence data.},
