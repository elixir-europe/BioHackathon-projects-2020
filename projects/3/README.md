# Project 3: ELIXIR Service Bundle for Epidemic Response

## Abstract

In the last few decades we have seen the surfacing and spreading of many novel pathogenic viruses.
Some were mutations of the traditional influenza viruses, and some were viruses that crossed the animal-human divide and became a threat to human lives.
An example of the former is the influenza A (H1N1) virus that caused a pandemic in 2009, while an example of the latter are highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9), A(H5N1), and A(H5N6), low pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N2), swine influenza A(H1N2)v and A(H3N2).

In the above cases, when a novel virus or bacterial strain for which there is no pre-existing immunity or a vaccine is released, there is the possibility of an epidemic or even a pandemic event, as the one we are experiencing today with COVID-19.

We believe that ELIXIR, as the reference European infrastructure for Life Science data, has the competence and the resources to make a difference in case of an outbreak.

In this context we propose a project to define an ELIXIR Service Bundle for Epidemic Response: a set of tools and workflows to facilitate and speed up the study of new pathogens, viruses or bacteria.
The final goal of the bundle will be to provide tools to collect and aggregate knowledge on novel viruses or pathogenic bacteria and their relation to hosts, not necessarily restricted to human-life threatening pathogens, for example in an epidemic event that threatens livestocks and crops.

**Project Number:** 3

**EasyChair Number:** 5

## Team

### Lead(s)

Castrense Savojardo castrense.savojardo2@unibo.it
 
Pier Luigi Martelli pierluigi.martelli@unibo.it

### Nominated participant(s)

Emidio Capriotti emidio.capriotti@unibo.it
 
Giulia Babbi giulia.babbi3@unibo.it

## Expected outcomes

The ideal final outcome would be a draft ELIXIR Service Bundle that can link together different tools and databases, and can provide a platform for a quick response in case of an outbreak, for example finding candidates for drug retargeting or finding phenotypes naturally resistant to the infection.

Possible outcomes are:
- Collection and detailed description of tools and databases
- Concept maps and/or workflows describing how tools and databases can be integrated
- Web page describing the service bundle

## Plan

- Define a set of use cases i.e. formal descriptions of scientific needs in the context of the analysis of new pathogens
- Tools/databases relevant for the use case are collected
- Each use case will be represented with a (TeSS) Concept Map or Workflow that organizes tools/databases

## Expected audience

- Scientific: experts in genomics of epidemic pathogens who can bring knowledge and help defining use cases and use scenarios
- Technical: GitHub, Concept map/workflow visualization, Interoperability, CWL
