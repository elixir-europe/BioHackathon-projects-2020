# Run CWL Conformance Tests

**Topic coordinator:** Michael R. Crusoe

[&#8629; All topics][topics-overview]

Design and implement a set of tests that that run [CWL v1.2][cwl-1.2]
[conformance tests][cwl-conformance-tests] against:

* [`cwl-tes`][cwl-tes] => [TESK][tesk]
* [cwl-WES][cwl-wes] => [`cwl-tes`][cwl-tes] => [TESK][tesk]

> Note that [cwl-WES][cwl-wes-req] uses a [forked version of
> `cwl-tes`][cwl-tes-fork] that does not include recent changes in neither the
> upstream [`cwl-tes`][cwl-tes] repository nor [`cwltool`][cwltool]. Thus,
> implementing the latter tests will need fixes on the [`cwl-tes`
> fork][cwl-tes-fork] (to include changes that have been made to the upstream
> repository in the meantime), as we as in [cwl-WES] (to fix errors that arise
> from running the `cwl-tes` version with the latest changes).
