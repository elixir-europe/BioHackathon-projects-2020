# Project 16: The ELIXIR Cloud

![logo-banner][logo-banner]

_The **ELIXIR Cloud** brings analysis to the data_ through a community
standards-powered, international and highly interoperable cloud computing
network.

  Cloud implementations and portals
* Write [**FAIR documentation**][topic-documentation] for end users, developers
  and/or system admins/devops
* Address [**open issues**][project-board] for any ELIXIR Cloud
  repository

If you have any other ideas, we are very happy to hear them! :)

### Where to start

1. Please join our project channel `#16_ga4ghcloud` on the official BH20 Slack
  space:  
  [![Chat][badge-chat-bh20]][chat-bh20]

2. Please let us know your GitHub handle. You are also
  encouraged to add your name, email address, ORCID &  GitHub handle to the
  [team](#team) section.

3. Please also have a look at our [contribution
  guidelines][contributing-guidelines] designed to make it easy for everyone to
  work together.

4. Importantly, please mind and abide by hackathon's [Code of
  Conduct][coc-bh20], as well as [ours][coc-elixir-cloud], to make sure
  everyone feels welcome and appreciated.

5. Let us know what [topic(s)](#topics) you would like to work on, and we will
  try to assemble a subteam and distribute issues. Alternatively, pick one or
  more issues from the common [project board][project-board] and assign
  yourself.

## Background

> _What's practice without theory?!_

### The ELIXIR Cloud & AAI Ecosystem

Championed by the [ELIXIR Compute Platform][elixir-compute], the [**ELIXIR
Cloud & AAI Ecosystem**][elixir-cloud] is a cross-platform effort within the
ELIXIR universe, and is a [Driver Project][ga4gh-drivers] of the [Global
Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)][ga4gh]. We are aligning with
international partners to deliver cloud-based population-scale genomic and
phenotypic data analysis to the biomedical research and healthcare community.

### The ELIXIR Cloud

The exponential increase in the amounts of data generated in the biomedical
sector as well as the vast computational resources required to analyse and
integrate them, present veritable barriers to the advancement of the biomedical
sciences. The sensitivity of health-related data further requires sophisticated
security measures to be put in place, which are difficult to implement and
maintain in a world of fragmented IT infrastructure as is typically found
across hospitals, research centers and industry. 

To help overcome these obstacles, the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH)][ga4gh], an internationally backed standard-setting organization
bringing together opinion leaders in academia and industry, has proposed a set
of _Cloud API specifications_ for enabling the adoption of [FAIR
principles][fair] for data, workflows and infrastructure. Based on these
specifications, the [ELIXIR Cloud & AAI][elixir-cloud] ecosystem is developing
the ELIXIR Cloud, a highly interoperable, federated cloud computing environment
that will allow authenticated users to execute language-agnostic large-scale
data analysis workflows across participating nodes.

To this end, we develop guidelines for consistent OAuth2-based authentication
and authorization regimes, implementations for each of the four [GA4GH
Cloud][ga4gh-cloud] standards, tools and services to enable federation at the
workflow and task level, as well as client applications that operationalise the
ELIXIR Cloud to end users.

**Incremental rollout of the ELIXIR Cloud to end users is planned to commence
in 2021.**

**Vision of an interoperable GA4GH-powered Cloud.** Each box represents a
cloud-native microservice or collection of microservices that can be readily
deployed on different infrastructures at, e.g., research institutes, compute
centers, hospitals or companies, and added to the network.
